It is syntactic sugar for the OCaml language\n  created in 1996. The new Reason syntax will look familiar to those who have\n  programmed in Javascript.\n\n  These challenges are originally from the workshop run by Jane Street to\n  teach OCaml. It was ported over to Reason with the help of `refmt` (Reason\n  format) binary that helps you convert to/from Reason/OCaml syntax.\n\n  This exercise is to familiarize you with the code-compile cycle.\n\n  To compile your code, run in a terminal session in the root directory\n\n    $ npm run build\n\n  You should see a compilation error because it's missing the end quote. Add\n  the end quote and re-run. You should see that the code compiled successfully!\n\n  For convenience you can build whenever you change the code by running the\n  compiler in watch mode. For that, run\n\n    $ npm run start\n\n  You can also execute code in Reason's REPL (rtop) directly. To start rtop from\n  your terminal run:\n\n    $ rtop\n\n  Now try pasting the code below into it.\n\n  *Note:* Use `Ctrl-d` to exit the rtop session.\n\n  Try these out and move on to the next exercise!\n */\nlet () = print_endline(\"Hello, World!);"}}}
